## Repository Generator in node.js using puppeteer
So this repository contains a node.js app that allows you to spin up headless chromium which helps you automate the process of creating a repository on github and at the end of the process it displays the link to your repo.

Assuming your repo name is 'peter22' and your password is 'freshjscoder' then to create a repo titled "myapp" follow these steps:- 

 - clone the repo
 - on your terminal run the codes below
 - run "npm install -g"
 - run "repo-gen peter22 freshjscoder myapp"
 - wait for it to resolve printing out your repo name
 
The npm install -g allows you to run this command from any directory.
